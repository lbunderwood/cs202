There's a dragon, crouched over a pile of  gold, jewels, and other treasures. He's asleep now, with a faint tendril of smoke rising from his nostrils. Best to leave while you can.

A faint flickering emanates from the room.
There is a bonfire in the center of the room, with a sword thrust point down into the center of the fire. You get the feeling that many weary SOULS (haha) have rested here.

What you can see of the room looks... very... cavey
The room is a very generic cave room. It has an abundance of stalagmites and stalactites sprouting from the floor and cieling. A small trickle of water runs down the far wall, accross the floor, and into a crack near your feet.
